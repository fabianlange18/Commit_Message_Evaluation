# Commit Message Evaluation


## Goal of the project

How can we assess the quality of generated commit messages by comparing their style? How many different styles are there? If a commit message in terms of style is far of the other commit messages we can probably determine that it is a bad commit message.

This can help with:

- Evaluating the generation of commit messages
- Improving the dataset creation by removing unfitting human commit messages.
